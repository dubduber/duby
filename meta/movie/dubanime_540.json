She loves spending her free time at the local library where she notices that the books she reads are often checked out by a boy named Seiji Amasawa.\r\nOne day while riding the local train, Shizuku notices a strange cat sitting near her. Why would an ordinary cat ride a train? Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it can also seriously harm a young girl. Shizuku decides to follow the mysterious cat to see where it goes, and soon stumbles upon an antique shop run by a violin maker named Nishi, the grandfather of the mystery boy who shares her taste in literature. Seiji and Shizuku soon become friends and while Seiji is sure of his dreams and how to follow them, Shizuku is still unsure of her own talents. However, when she sees a strange cat statuette, “The Baron”, in the shop, it seems as if that statuette whispers something to her, tugging at her heart and giving her the inspiration she so desperately needed. One voice pushes Shizuku further than she could have ever imagined, changing her life forever.","releaseInfo":"1995","year":"1995","imdbRating":8.235,"userCount":19026,"status":"finished","runtime":"111 min","trailers":[{"source":"0pVkiod6V0U","type":"Trailer"}],"imdb_id":"tt0113824","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0113824/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
