Hotaru no Haka, also known as Grave of the Fireflies, is the story of Seita and his sister Setsuko, two Japanese children whose lives are ravaged by the brutal war. They have lost their mother, their home, and the prospect of a bright futureâ€”all tragic consequences of a single air raid.\r\nNow orphaned and homeless, Seita and Setsuko have no choice but to drift across the countryside,  beset by starvation and disease. Met with the apathy of adults along the way, they find that desperate circumstances can turn even the kindest of people cruel yet their youthful hope shines brightly in the face of unrelenting hardship, preventing the siblings from swiftly succumbing to an inevitable fate.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1988","year":"1988","imdbRating":8.259,"userCount":36323,"status":"finished","runtime":"88 min","trailers":[{"source":"4vPeTSRd580","type":"Trailer"}],"imdb_id":"tt0095327","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0095327/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
