It was the first full-dive system, and with it, came endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.\r\n\r\nIn 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its successor, the Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn't have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is \"Ordinal Scale\" (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma.\r\n\r\nAsuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, by the time Kirito decides to join them. They're about to find out that Ordinal Scale isn't all fun and games...\r\n\r\n(Source: Aniplex USA)","releaseInfo":"2017","year":"2017","imdbRating":7.909000000000001,"userCount":27294,"status":"finished","runtime":"110 min","trailers":[{"source":"VNxxReVeVDI","type":"Trailer"}],"imdb_id":"tt5544384","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt5544384/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
