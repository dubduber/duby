That castle is home to the magnificent wizard Howl, infamous for both his magical prowess and for being a womanizer—or so the rumor goes in Sophie Hatter's small town. Sophie, as the plain daughter of a hatmaker, does not expect much from her future and is content with working hard in the shop. \r\nHowever, Sophie's simple life takes a turn for the exciting when she is ensnared in a disturbing situation, and the mysterious wizard appears to rescue her. Unfortunately, this encounter, brief as it may be, spurs the vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste—in a fit of jealousy caused by a past discord with Howl—to put a curse on the maiden, turning her into an old woman.\r\nIn an endeavor to return to normal, Sophie must accompany Howl and a myriad of eccentric companions—ranging from a powerful fire demon to a hopping scarecrow—in his living castle, on a dangerous adventure as a raging war tears their kingdom apart.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2004","year":"2004","imdbRating":8.272,"userCount":94256,"status":"finished","runtime":"117 min","trailers":[{"source":"iwROgK94zcM","type":"Trailer"}],"imdb_id":"tt0347149","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0347149/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
