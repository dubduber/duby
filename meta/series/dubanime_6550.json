Things seem to be looking up for Issei when a beautiful girl asks him out on a date, although she turns out to be a fallen angel who brutally kills him! However, he gets a second chance at life when beautiful senior student Rias Gremory, who is a top-class devil, revives him as her servant, recruiting Issei into the ranks of the school's Occult Research club.\r\nSlowly adjusting to his new life, Issei must train and fight in order to survive in the violent world of angels and devils. Each new adventure leads to many hilarious (and risqu√©) moments with his new comrades, all the while keeping his new life a secret from his friends and family in High School DxD!\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","year":"2012","imdbRating":7.445,"userCount":53845,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"f4E8al_wo8w","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_6550:1","title":"Got a Girlfriend!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_6550:2","title":"I'm Done Being Human!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_6550:3","title":"I Made a Friend!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_6550:4","title":"I'm Saving My Friend!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_6550:5","title":"I Will Defeat My Ex-girlfriend!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_6550:6","title":"I Work as a Devil!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_6550:7","title":"I Get a Familiar!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_6550:8","title":"I Pick a Fight!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_6550:9","title":"I've Begun My Training!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_6550:10","title":"The Showdown Begins!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_6550:11","title":"The Acclaimed Battle Continues!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_6550:12","title":"I'm Here to Keep My Promise!","released":"2012-01-06T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt2230051","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt2230051","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt2230051/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
