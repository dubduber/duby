But his youthful fantasies were shattered by a mercenary raid. Raised by the Vikings who murdered his family, Thorfinn became a terrifying warrior, forever seeking to kill the band's leader, Askeladd, and avenge his father. Sustaining Throfinn through his ordeal are his pride in his family and his dreams of a fertile westward land, a land without war or slavery â€¦ the land Leif called Vinland.\r\n\r\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)","releaseInfo":"2019","year":"2019","imdbRating":8.267,"userCount":16435,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"3xAlirMzjCQ","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_41084:1","title":"Somewhere not here","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_41084:2","title":"Sword","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_41084:3","title":"Troll","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_41084:4","title":"A True Warrior","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_41084:5","title":"The Troll's Son","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_41084:6","title":"The journey begins","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_41084:7","title":"Normanni","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_41084:8","title":"Beyond the edge of the sea","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_41084:9","title":"The Battle of London Bridge","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_41084:10","title":"Ragnarock","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_41084:11","title":"A Gamble","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_41084:12","title":"The Land on the Far Bank","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_41084:13","title":"Child of a Hero","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_41084:14","title":"The Light of Dawn","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_41084:15","title":"After Yule","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_41084:16","title":"History of Beasts","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_41084:17","title":"Servant","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_41084:18","title":"Out of the Cradle","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_41084:19","title":"United Front","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_41084:20","title":"Crown","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_41084:21","title":"Episode 21","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_41084:22","title":"Episode 22","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_41084:23","title":"Episode 23","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_41084:24","title":"Episode 24","released":"2019-07-08T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt10233448","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt10233448","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt10233448/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
