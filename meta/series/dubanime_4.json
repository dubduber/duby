Robin, a 15-year-old craft user, arrives from Italy to Japan to work for an organization named STN Japan Division (STN-J) as a replacement for one of STN-J's witch hunters who was recently killed. Unlike other divisions of STN, STN-J tries to capture the witches alive in order to learn why and how they became witches in the first place.\r\n(Source: ANN)","releaseInfo":"2002","year":"2002","imdbRating":7.245,"userCount":6638,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"7UkaILjPk8M","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_4:1","title":"Replacement","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_4:2","title":"Addicted to Power","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_4:3","title":"Dancing in Darkness","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_4:4","title":"Stubborn Aesthetics","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_4:5","title":"Smells Like the Wandering Spirit","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_4:6","title":"Raindrops","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_4:7","title":"Simple-Mind","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_4:8","title":"Faith","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_4:9","title":"Sign of the Craft","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_4:10","title":"Separate Lives","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_4:11","title":"The Soul Cages","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_4:12","title":"Precious Illusions","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_4:13","title":"The Eyes of Truth","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_4:14","title":"Loaded Guns","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_4:15","title":"Time to Say Goodbye","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_4:16","title":"Heal the Pain","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_4:17","title":"Dilemma","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_4:18","title":"In My Pocket","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_4:19","title":"Missing","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_4:20","title":"All I Really Oughta Know","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_4:21","title":"No Way Out","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_4:22","title":"Family Portrait","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_4:23","title":"Sympathy for the Devil","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_4:24","title":"Rent","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_4:25","title":"Redemption Day","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.025Z","season":1,"episode":25,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":25},{"id":"dubanime_4:26","title":"Time to Tell","released":"2002-07-02T00:00:00.026Z","season":1,"episode":26,"imdb_id":"tt0402716","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":26}],"imdb_id":"tt0402716","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0402716/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
