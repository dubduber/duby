When it became co-ed, the girls, out of fear, asked to be permitted to bring weapons to school. When that was enforced, a five-member vigilante corps-like organization called the \"Supreme Five Swords\" was also formed.\r\n\r\nAfter many generations, the five swords eventually became a group which corrected problematic students, and the academy started proactively accepting such students in order to correct them.\r\n\r\nNomura Fudou was sent to this school after being part of a huge brawl. What will he do when the only options he has after enrolling are being expelled from that school or being corrected the way the rest of the male students there were...by being forced to dress and act like a girl!\r\n\r\n(Source: Batoto)","releaseInfo":"2017","year":"2017","imdbRating":6.9799999999999995,"userCount":12230,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"h4kbv04w1Zs","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_12265:1","title":"The Magnificent Blade, Rin Onigawara","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_12265:2","title":"The Chastity Dorm Riot","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_12265:3","title":"The Fair Sword, Mary Kikakujo","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_12265:4","title":"The Warabinpics are Starting!","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_12265:5","title":"The Love-Crazed Blade, Warabi Hanasaka","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_12265:6","title":"Notes on a Scandal","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_12265:7","title":"The Dubious Sword, Satori Tamaba","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_12265:8","title":"His and Crossdressing Her Circumstances","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_12265:9","title":"The Day Love Died","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_12265:10","title":"The Terrifying Blade, Tsukuyo Inaba","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_12265:11","title":"The Magic Bullet I'll Always Remember","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_12265:12","title":"The Girls' Machiavellism","released":"2017-04-05T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt9013220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt9013220","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt9013220/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
