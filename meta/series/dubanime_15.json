Between school, friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight.School Rumble is a high-octane romantic comedy full of relatable situations, as Tenma and Kenji both try to win the hearts of those they desire.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2004-2005","year":"2004-2005","imdbRating":7.8790000000000004,"userCount":18714,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"0Uv3_zjM448","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_15:1","title":"Pounding Heart at a New School Term!
