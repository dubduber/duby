Within the game, he's a 15-year-old named Satou. At first he thinks he's dreaming, but his experiences seem very real. Due to a powerful ability he possesses with limited use, he ends up wiping out an army of lizard men and becomes a high leveled adventurer. Satou decides to hide his level, and plans to live peacefully and meet new people. However, developments in the game's story, such as the return of a demon king, may cause a nuisance to Satou's plans.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL News)","releaseInfo":"2018","year":"2018","imdbRating":6.742,"userCount":16361,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"0NzZvYIyb0c","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_13276:1","title":"The Catastrophe That Started with a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_13276:2","title":"Exploring a City That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_13276:3","title":"Love That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_13276:4","title":"Labyrinth Exploration That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_13276:5","title":"The Crazy Princess That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_13276:6","title":"City Defense That Began With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_13276:7","title":"Camping Lessons That Began With A Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_13276:8","title":"Immortality That Began With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_13276:9","title":"Deeply Held Attachment That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_13276:10","title":"The Hunting Song That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_13276:11","title":"The Fantasy Conspiracy That Started with a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_13276:12","title":"A Trip to the Underworld That Started With a Death March","released":"2018-01-11T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt7712706","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt7712706","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt7712706/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
