Downtrodden and homeless, she runs into a man being harassed by a dog. After helping him, she explains her situation, and to her surprise, he offers her his home in gratitude. But when she discovers that said home is a rundown shrine, she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake her for the man Nanami rescuedâ€”the land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human.\r\nRather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her divine duties. But if she must keep things running smoothly, she will need the help of a certain hot-headed fox. In her fumbling attempt to seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and ends up sealing a contract with him. Now the two must traverse the path of godhood together as god and familiar; but it will not be easy, for new threats arise in the form of a youkai who wants to devour the girl, a snake that wants to marry her, and Nanami's own unexpected feelings for her new familiar.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","year":"2012","imdbRating":8.239,"userCount":28489,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"1XfNOoTrGZQ","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_7157:1","title":"Nanami Becomes a God","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_7157:2","title":"The God Becomes a Target","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_7157:3","title":"The God Makes a Match","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_7157:4","title":"The God Is Kidnapped","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_7157:5","title":"The God Is Kidnapped","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_7157:6","title":"The God Catches a Cold","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_7157:7","title":"The God Asks a Boy Out On a Date","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_7157:8","title":"The God Goes to the Beach","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_7157:9","title":"The God Goes to the Dragon King's Palace","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_7157:10","title":"Tomoe Becomes a Familiar / The God Goes to a Mixer","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_7157:11","title":"The Familiar Goes Into Town","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_7157:12","title":"Nanami Quits Being a God","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_7157:13","title":"I've Started the \"Being a God\" Thing","released":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt2320220","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13}],"imdb_id":"tt2320220","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt2320220/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
