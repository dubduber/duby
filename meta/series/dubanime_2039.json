At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality.\r\nBased on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger storyâ€”one of alchemy, survival and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","releaseInfo":"2007","year":"2007","imdbRating":8.251999999999999,"userCount":61012,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"W5bn87yvh_g","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_2039:1","title":"The Vice President Doesn't Say Anything about the Possibility of Him Being the Main Character","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_2039:2","title":"Setting the Old Woman's Qualms Aside, the Flying Pussyfoot Departs","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_2039:3","title":"Randy and Pecho Are Busy Getting Ready for the Party","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_2039:4","title":"Ladd Russo Enjoys Talking A Lot and Slaughtering A Lot","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_2039:5","title":"Jacuzzi Splot Cries, Gets Scared and Musters Reckless Valor","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_2039:6","title":"The Rail Tracer Covertly, Repeatedly Slaughters Inside the Coaches","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_2039:7","title":"Everything Starts Aboard the Advenna Avis","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_2039:8","title":"Isaac and Miria Unintentionally Spread Happiness Around Them","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_2039:9","title":"Claire Stanfield Faithfully Carries Out the Mission","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_2039:10","title":"Czeslaw Meyer is Forced to Rework His Tremble-Before-the-Specter-of-Immortals Strategy","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_2039:11","title":"Chane Laforet Remains Silent in the Face of Two Mysterious People","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_2039:12","title":"Firo and the Three Gandor Brothers Are Felled by Assassins' Bullets","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_2039:13","title":"Both the Immortals and Those Who Aren't Sing the Praises of Life Equally","released":"2007-07-27T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt1334722","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13}],"imdb_id":"tt1334722","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1334722/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
