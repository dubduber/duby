Witnessing the Black Rider on his first day in the city, his wishes already seem to have been granted. But as supernatural events begin to occur, ordinary citizens like himself, along with Ikebukuro's most colorful inhabitants, are mixed up in the commotion breaking out in their city.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2010","year":"2010","imdbRating":8.236,"userCount":77321,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"q5qlX4lWst0","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_4696:1","title":"Exit 1, First Words","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_4696:2","title":"Highly Unpredictable","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_4696:3","title":"Rampant Evil","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_4696:4","title":"Utterly Alone","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_4696:5","title":"False Advertising","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_4696:6","title":"Active Interest","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_4696:7","title":"Bad-ass Dude","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_4696:8","title":"Ephemeral Dream","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_4696:9","title":"Love and Cherish","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_4696:10","title":"Never Before Seen","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_4696:11","title":"Storm and Stress (Sturm und Drang)","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_4696:12","title":"Yin and Yang","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_4696:13","title":"Takes A Sudden Turn","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_4696:14","title":"Turmoil Reigns","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_4696:15","title":"Dumb Like a Fox","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_4696:16","title":"Mutual Love","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_4696:17","title":"Everything Changes","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_4696:18","title":"Out of Your Control","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_4696:19","title":"Anarchy","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_4696:20","title":"A New King Will Arise","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_4696:21","title":"Everything Covered in Fog","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_4696:22","title":"Declaration of Disbandment","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_4696:23","title":"Complicated and Confused","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_4696:24","title":"Selfless Devotion","released":"2010-01-08T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt1584000","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt1584000","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1584000/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
