Contracted by powerful mob syndicates and police alike, the Handymen have to be ready and willing for anything. After completing the order of killing a local pimp, the Handymen add Alex Benedetto—a prostitute also designated for elimination—to their ranks to protect her from forces that want her gone from the decrepit hellhole of a city she has come to call home. However, this criminal’s paradise is undergoing a profound period of change that threatens to corrode the delicate balance of power.\r\nErgastalum was once a safe haven for \"Twilights,\" super-human beings born as the result of a special drug but are now being hunted down by a fierce underground organization. This new threat is rising up to challenge everything the city stands for, and the Handymen will not be able to avoid this coming war.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2015","year":"2015","imdbRating":7.367,"userCount":27537,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"llcwN3KvuXA","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_8576:1","title":"Naughty Boys","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_8576:2","title":"Hundemarken","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_8576:3","title":"Ergastulum","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_8576:4","title":"Nonconformist","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_8576:5","title":"Sanctions","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_8576:6","title":"Thorn","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_8576:7","title":"Birth","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_8576:8","title":"Evening Dress","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_8576:9","title":"Siblings","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_8576:10","title":"Land of Confusion","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_8576:11","title":"Absence","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_8576:12","title":"Odds and Ends","released":"2015-07-02T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt5025394","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt5025394","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt5025394/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
