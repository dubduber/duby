The club consists of: Taichi Yaegashi, a hardcore wrestling fan; Iori Nagase, an indecisive optimist; Himeko Inaba, a calm computer genius; Yui Kiriyama, a petite karate practitioner; and Yoshifumi Aoki, the class clown.\r\nOne day, Aoki and Yui experience a strange incident when, without warning, they switch bodies for a short period of time. As this supernatural phenomenon continues to occur randomly amongst the five friends, they begin to realize that it is not just fun and games. Now forced to become closer than ever, they soon discover each other's hidden secrets and emotional scars, which could end up tearing the StuCS and their friendship apart.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012","year":"2012","imdbRating":7.8629999999999995,"userCount":42231,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"MnkqA_PRRhM","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_6626:1","title":"A Story That Had Already Begun Before Anyone Realized It","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_6626:2","title":"Some Fascinating Humans","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_6626:3","title":"Jobber and Low Blow","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_6626:4","title":"Twin Feelings","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_6626:5","title":"A Confession and Death......","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_6626:6","title":"A Story That Continued Before Anyone Realized It","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_6626:7","title":"Falling Apart","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_6626:8","title":"And Then There Were None","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_6626:9","title":"Can't Stop Can't Stop Can't Stop","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_6626:10","title":"Putting into Words","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_6626:11","title":"A Story That Began As We Realized It","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_6626:12","title":"Into a Snowy City","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_6626:13","title":"As Long as the Five of Us Are Together","released":"2012-07-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt2250034","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13}],"imdb_id":"tt2250034","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt2250034/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
