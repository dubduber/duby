For one woman warrior however, an early defeat clearly shows her that she is lacking in experience though she may be bountiful in body.\r\nFortunately, while defeat could spell one's doom, her life is saved by a powerful stranger. But unfortunately for this savior, less-than-pure motives and shrewd family members mean her reward is a prison cell. Her release is prompt when the unseasoned warrior she saved, tired of her current lifestyle of nobility, sets off to prove herself.\r\n(Source: Media Blasters)","releaseInfo":"2009","year":"2009","imdbRating":5.829,"userCount":6111,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":"","videos":[{"id":"dubanime_7762:1","title":"High Spirits: The Vagrant Warrior","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1},{"id":"dubanime_7762:2","title":"Ambitious Undertaking: Warrior Priestess","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2},{"id":"dubanime_7762:3","title":"Charm Attack: Veteran Mercenary","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3},{"id":"dubanime_7762:4","title":"Rivalry: Thundercloud General","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4},{"id":"dubanime_7762:5","title":"Resurrected Curse: Ancient Princess","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5},{"id":"dubanime_7762:6","title":"Promise: Forest Keeper","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6},{"id":"dubanime_7762:7","title":"Advent: Angel of Light","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7},{"id":"dubanime_7762:8","title":"Stealth: Assassin of the Fang","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8},{"id":"dubanime_7762:9","title":"The Arms Dealer and the Steel Princess","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9},{"id":"dubanime_7762:10","title":"Enlightenment: Blow of the Dragon","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10},{"id":"dubanime_7762:11","title":"Thunder: After the Death Battle","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11},{"id":"dubanime_7762:12","title":"Final Destiny","released":"2009-04-02T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12}]},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
