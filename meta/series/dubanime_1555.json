Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world.\r\n\r\nAlthough Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2007-2017","year":"2007-2017","imdbRating":8.132,"userCount":75481,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"1dy2zPPrKD0","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_1555:1","title":"Homecoming","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_1555:2","title":"The Akatsuki Makes Its Move","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_1555:3","title":"The Results of Training","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_1555:4","title":"The Jinchuriki of the Sand","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_1555:5","title":"The Kazekage Stands Tall","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_1555:6","title":"Mission Cleared","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_1555:7","title":"Run, Kankuro","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_1555:8","title":"Team Kakashi, Deployed","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_1555:9","title":"The Jinchuriki's Tears","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_1555:10","title":"Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_1555:11","title":"The Medical Ninja's Student","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_1555:12","title":"The Retired Granny's Determination","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_1555:13","title":"A Meeting With Destiny","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_1555:14","title":"Naruto's Growth","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_1555:15","title":"The Secret Weapon is Called....","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_1555:16","title":"The Secret of Jinchuriki","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_1555:17","title":"The Death of Gaara!","released":"2007-02-15T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_1555:18","title":"Charge Tactic!
