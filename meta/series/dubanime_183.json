As a quiet peace and unity finally become foreseeable over the land, an unknown evil begins to stir. An ancient witch has awakened, bent on preserving the island of Lodoss by creating political unbalance throughout the many kingdoms and keeping any one from maintaining central control. Only a mixed-race party of six young champions, led by the young warrior Parn, stand between this new threat and Lodoss' descent back into the darkness of war and destruction. \r\n(Source: ANN) ","releaseInfo":"1990-1991","year":"1990-1991","imdbRating":7.368,"userCount":4113,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"CVc7JrTh6g0","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_183:1","title":"Prologue to the Legend","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_183:2","title":"Blazing Departure","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_183:3","title":"The Black Knight","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_183:4","title":"The Grey Witch","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_183:5","title":"The Desert King","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_183:6","title":"The Sword of the Dark Emperor","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_183:7","title":"The War of Heroes","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_183:8","title":"Requiem for Warriors","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_183:9","title":"The Scepter of Domination","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_183:10","title":"The Demon Dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_183:11","title":"The Wizard's Ambition","released":"1990-06-30T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0100044","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_183:12","title":"Final Battle!
