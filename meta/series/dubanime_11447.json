Thrown into a foreign land with nothing but hazy memories and the knowledge of their name, they can feel only these three emotions resonating deep within their souls. A group of strangers is given no other choice than to accept the only paying job in this game-like world—the role of a soldier in the Reserve Army—and eliminate anything that threatens the peace in their new world, Grimgar.\r\n\r\nWhen all of the stronger candidates join together, those left behind must create a party together to survive: Manato, a charismatic leader and priest; Haruhiro, a nervous thief; Yume, a cheerful hunter; Shihoru, a shy mage; Mogzo, a kind warrior; and Ranta, a rowdy dark knight. Despite its resemblance to one, this is no game—there are no redos or respawns; it is kill or be killed.\r\n\r\nIt is now up to this ragtag group of unlikely fighters to survive together in a world where life and death are separated only by a fine line.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2016","year":"2016","imdbRating":7.737,"userCount":30774,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"nFhwqXYchiY","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_11447:1","title":"Whisper, Chant, Prayer, Awaken","released":"2016-01-11T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt5341430","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_11447:2","title":"Long Day of the Trainee Volunteer Soldier","released":"2016-01-11T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt5341430","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_11447:3","title":"Are Goblin Pouches Filled with Our Dreams?","released":"2016-01-11T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt5341430","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_11447:4","title":"Sky Dancing with Ash","released":"2016-01-11T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt5341430","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_11447:5","title":"Crying Doesn't Mean You're Weak.
