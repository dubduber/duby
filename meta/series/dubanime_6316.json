However, Kodaka discovers he is out of luck when he immediately gets labeled as a violent delinquent due to his blond hair and intimidating expression. Although a month has passed, Kodaka is still alone thanks to his notorious reputation. However, his life begins to change when he finds fellow loner Yozora Mikazuki talking to her imaginary friend in an empty classroom.\r\nAfter sharing stories of their lonely high school life, Kodaka and Yozora decide to overcome the difficulties of making friends together by starting the Neighbor's Club. Created for people who don't have friends, daily activities involve learning social skills and how to fit in, which will hopefully allow them to make friends. Joined by the eroge-loving Sena Kashiwazaki, and other eccentric outcasts, Kodaka may finally have managed to find people he can call friends, in this club filled with hilarious oddballs.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2011","year":"2011","imdbRating":7.386,"userCount":43076,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"LQRZ8SgLilg","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_6316:1","title":"We Can't Make Any Friends","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_6316:2","title":"There's No God in the Electric World","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_6316:3","title":"There Are No Flags at the Swimming Pool","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_6316:4","title":"Underclassmen Don't Hold Back","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_6316:5","title":"This Time, the SAGA is a Serious Battle","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_6316:6","title":"There Aren't Many Customers At the Karaoke Box","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_6316:7","title":"My Cell Phone Doesn't Get Many Calls","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_6316:8","title":"School Swimsuits Don't Appear","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_6316:9","title":"The President's Recollections are Painful","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_6316:10","title":"No One Sleeps at Camp","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_6316:11","title":"Girls Are Super-Cute in Yukatas","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_6316:12","title":"We Don't Have Many Friends","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt2645500","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt2645500","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt2645500/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
