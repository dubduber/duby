It is written in ancient myths that the first emperor, along with eight warriors, slew a water demon to avoid a great drought and save the land that was to become Shin Yogo. If a water demon was to appear once more, its death could bring salvation. However, the water demon manifests itself within the body of the emperor's son, Prince Chagumâ€”by the emperor's order, Chagum is to be sacrificed to save the empire.\r\nMeanwhile, a mysterious spear-wielding mercenary named Balsa arrives in Shin Yogo on business. After saving Chagum from a thinly veiled assassination attempt, she is tasked by Chagum's mother to protect him from the emperor and his hunters. Bound by a sacred vow she once made, Balsa accepts.Seirei no Moribito follows Balsa as she embarks on her journey to protect Chagum, exploring the beauty of life, nature, family, and the bonds that form between strangers.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2007","year":"2007","imdbRating":8.09,"userCount":14620,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"9I8doA-vYvU","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_1644:1","title":"Balsa, the Female Bodyguard","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_1644:2","title":"Hunters, Hunted","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_1644:3","title":"Fight to the Death","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_1644:4","title":"Torogai's Letter","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_1644:5","title":"Secret Plan, the Blue Hand","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_1644:6","title":"To Die in the Misty Blue","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_1644:7","title":"Chagum's Resolve","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_1644:8","title":"The Swordsmith","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_1644:9","title":"Shuga Thirsts","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_1644:10","title":"Soil and Heroes","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_1644:11","title":"Flower Wine for Tanda","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_1644:12","title":"The Summer Solstice Festival","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_1644:13","title":"Neither Human Nor Tiger","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_1644:14","title":"The Knot","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_1644:15","title":"Unexpected Death","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_1644:16","title":"With All One's Heart","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_1644:17","title":"The Water Mill Burns","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_1644:18","title":"The Ancient Village","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_1644:19","title":"Escape","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_1644:20","title":"To Hunter's Hole","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_1644:21","title":"Jiguro Musa","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_1644:22","title":"Season of Awakening","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_1644:23","title":"In Search of the Shigu Salua","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_1644:24","title":"The Last Hope","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_1644:25","title":"Celebration","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.025Z","season":1,"episode":25,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":25},{"id":"dubanime_1644:26","title":"Departure","released":"2007-04-07T00:00:00.026Z","season":1,"episode":26,"imdb_id":"tt1029248","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":26}],"imdb_id":"tt1029248","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1029248/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
