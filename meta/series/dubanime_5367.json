Instead of moving up in the world, the girls are more interested in getting closer to the guys in the gang!\r\nOf course, some of the boys are totally oblivious to the romantic intentions of their female friends. That's to be expected in a group of dim-wits and misfits. Nonetheless, the femmes of Class F aren't giving up anytime soon. Because when love is on the line, even the biggest underachievers can find motivation – even if they can't spell it!\r\n(Source: Rightstuf)","releaseInfo":"2011","year":"2011","imdbRating":7.802,"userCount":22444,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"LcH6R5Wt8FI","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_5367:1","title":"Me, Everyone, and Swimming in the Ocean!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_5367:2","title":"Me, Yukata, and Festivities!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_5367:3","title":"Me, That Girl, and a Stuffed Toy!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_5367:4","title":"Me, TRUE Colors and a Man's Dignity!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_5367:5","title":"Me, Peeking, and Training Camp!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_5367:6","title":"Me, Peeking, and Guys' Friendship!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_5367:7","title":"Me, Peeking, and Far Away Paradise!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_5367:8","title":"Me, Japan, and Unknown Words!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_5367:9","title":"Me, Romance, and Negotiation Skills!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_5367:10","title":"Me, Romance, and Love Skills!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_5367:11","title":"Yuuji, Shouko, and Childhood Memories!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_5367:12","title":"Idiots, Clownery, and Requiem!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_5367:13","title":"BAKA and TEST - Summon The Beasts!","released":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt1655610","imdbSeason":2,"imdbEpisode":13}],"imdb_id":"tt1655610","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1655610/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
