The dragon, named Tohru, has the ability to magically transform into an adorable human girl (albeit with horns and a long tail!), who will do anything to pay off her debt of gratitude, whether Miss Kobayashi likes it or not. With a very persistent and amorous dragon as a roommate, nothing comes easy, and Miss Kobayashi’s normal life is about to go off the deep end!\r\n\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2017","year":"2017","imdbRating":8.254000000000001,"userCount":48240,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"8JME_Pa8rgY","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_12243:1","title":"The Strongest Maid in History, Tohru!
