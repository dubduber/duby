Following her only lead—the missing half of his invention, the Scissor Blade—she arrives at the prestigious Honnouji Academy, a high school unlike any other. The academy is ruled by the imposing and cold-hearted student council president Satsuki Kiryuuin alongside her powerful underlings, the Elite Four. In the school's brutally competitive hierarchy, Satsuki bestows upon those at the top special clothes called \"Goku Uniforms,\" which grant the wearer unique superhuman abilities.\r\n\r\nThoroughly beaten in a fight against one of the students in uniform, Ryuuko retreats to her razed home where she stumbles across Senketsu, a rare and sentient \"Kamui,\" or God Clothes. After coming into contact with Ryuuko's blood, Senketsu awakens, latching onto her and providing her with immense power. Now, armed with Senketsu and the Scissor Blade, Ryuuko makes a stand against the Elite Four, hoping to reach Satsuki and uncover the culprit behind her father's murder once and for all.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2013-2014","year":"2013-2014","imdbRating":8.193000000000001,"userCount":85307,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"B98NY8Hfo7I","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_7712:1","title":"If Only I Had Thorns Like a Thistle...","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_7712:2","title":"So Sexy She Might Pass Out","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_7712:3","title":"Junketsu","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_7712:4","title":"Dawn of a Miserable Morning","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_7712:5","title":"Trigger","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_7712:6","title":"Don't Toy With Me on a Whim","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_7712:7","title":"A Loser I Can't Hate","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_7712:8","title":"I Will Wipe My Own Tears","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_7712:9","title":"A Once in a Lifetime Chance","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_7712:10","title":"I Want to Know More About You","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_7712:11","title":"I'm Not Your Cute Woman","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_7712:12","title":"Spit Your Sadness Away","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_7712:13","title":"Crazy for You","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_7712:14","title":"Ride Like the Wind","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_7712:15","title":"Don't Stop Me Now","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_7712:16","title":"The Girl Can't Help It","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_7712:17","title":"Tell Me Why","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_7712:18","title":"Into the Night","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_7712:19","title":"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_7712:20","title":"Far from the Madding Crowd","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_7712:21","title":"Incomplete","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_7712:22","title":"Tell Me How You Feel","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_7712:23","title":"Imitation Gold","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_7712:24","title":"Past the Infinite Darkness","released":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt3114390","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt3114390","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt3114390/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
