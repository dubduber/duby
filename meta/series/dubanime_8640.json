However, the monster, dubbed Koro-sensei (the indestructible teacher), is able to fly at speeds of up to Mach 20, which he demonstrates freely, leaving any attempt to subdue him in his extraterrestrial dust. Furthermore, the misfits of 3-E soon find that the strange, tentacled beast is more than just indomitableâ€”he is the best teacher they have ever had!\r\n\r\nAdapted from the humorous hit manga by Yuusei Matsui, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu tells the story of these junior high pupils as they polish their assassination skills and grow in order to stand strong against the oppressive school system, their own life problems, and one day, Koro-sensei.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2015","year":"2015","imdbRating":8.283,"userCount":95486,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"kgNkGohA20k","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_8640:1","title":"Assassination Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_8640:2","title":"Baseball Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_8640:3","title":"Karma Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_8640:4","title":"Grown-Up Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_8640:5","title":"Assembly Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_8640:6","title":"Test Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_8640:7","title":"School Trip Time - 1st Period","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_8640:8","title":"School Trip Time - 2nd Period","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_8640:9","title":"Transfer Student Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_8640:10","title":"LR Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_8640:11","title":"Transfer Student Time - 2nd Period","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_8640:12","title":"Ball Game Tournament Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_8640:13","title":"Talent Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_8640:14","title":"Vision Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_8640:15","title":"End-of-Term Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_8640:16","title":"School's Out - 1st Term","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_8640:17","title":"Island Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_8640:18","title":"Action Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_8640:19","title":"Pandemonium Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_8640:20","title":"Karma Time - 2nd Period","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_8640:21","title":"XX Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_8640:22","title":"Nagisa Time","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt3837246","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22}],"imdb_id":"tt3837246","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt3837246/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
