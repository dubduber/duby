Shortly after Yuu's arrival, a chain of mysterious killings begin to occur on foggy days. At the same time, rumors about a strange television channel—dubbed the \"Midnight Channel\"—spread like wildfire; when staring into their TV screen at midnight, a person may see their soul mate.\r\nAfter witnessing the most recent murder victim on the Midnight Channel, Yuu attempts to watch it again, only to realize that he can traverse into the TV and reach another world overrun with \"Shadows,\" evil creatures of the dark. Realizing the link behind the hidden dimension and the murders, Yuu and his friends attempt to crack the cases by exploring the diabolical world of the Midnight Channel using their \"Personas,\" awakened manifestations of their \"true selves.\" \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2011-2012","year":"2011-2012","imdbRating":7.499,"userCount":18907,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"wCJr63UUMf0","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_6255:1","title":"You're Myself, I'm Yourself","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_6255:2","title":"The Contractor's Key","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_6255:3","title":"We Are Friends, Aren't We?","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_6255:4","title":"Somewhere Not Here","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_6255:5","title":"Would You Love Me?","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_6255:6","title":"I'll Beat You, and Beat You Good","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_6255:7","title":"Suspicious Tropical Paradise","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_6255:8","title":"We've Lost Something Important Again!","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_6255:9","title":"No One Sees the Real Me","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_6255:10","title":"Real Me Doesn't Exist","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_6255:11","title":"Catch Me if You Can","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_6255:12","title":"It's Not Empty at All","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_6255:13","title":"A Stormy Summer Vacation, Part 1","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_6255:14","title":"A Stormy Summer Vacation, Part 2","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_6255:15","title":"The Long-Awaited School Trip","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_6255:16","title":"Although the Case Was Closed","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_6255:17","title":"I Want to Know the Truth","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_6255:18","title":"Anniversary to Become a Family","released":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt2387612","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_6255:19","title":"It's School Festival Day!
