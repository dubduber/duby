Even more, they seem to think of Ritsuka as a troublemaker. Led by the handsome Rem Kaginuki, the student council—also consisting of Urie Sogami, Shiki Natsumizaka and Mage Nanashiro—tries to question her, but it soon becomes clear that they have ulterior motives. \r\nHowever, this is only the beginning. When her mother gets kidnapped, her life is turned upside down, and Ritsuka gets drawn into a world of vampires and devils. Both groups are searching for the \"Grimoire,\" a forbidden item allowing its owner to rule the world. The return of her brother Lindo from overseas gives her hope, but even he appears to be hiding something. In a world filled with secrets, Ritsuka questions whom she can trust in this dark musical tale, while the handsome and dangerous members of the student council compete for her attention. \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2015","year":"2015","imdbRating":6.499,"userCount":6374,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"BlypWQna4cQ","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_10453:1","title":"Depravity and the Forbidden Quadrille","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_10453:2","title":"Jitterbug of Doubts and Secrets","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_10453:3","title":"Tango of Passion and Seduction","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_10453:4","title":"Bolero of Solitude and Melancholy","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_10453:5","title":"B-Boying of Vainglory and Impulse","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_10453:6","title":"Farandole of Reminiscence and Labyrinths","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_10453:7","title":"Pas de Deux of Fantasy and Innocence","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_10453:8","title":"Waltz of Transience","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_10453:9","title":"War Cry of Secrets and Contrariness","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_10453:10","title":"Tarantella of Desire and Deceit","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_10453:11","title":"Samba of Jet and Crimson","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_10453:12","title":"Opera Ball of Endings and Beginnings","released":"2015-10-07T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt5324094","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt5324094"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
