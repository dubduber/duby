Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to the Kamogawa boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo's classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo's journey to the top of the boxing world begins.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2000-2002","year":"2000-2002","imdbRating":8.237,"userCount":27949,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"7xM3XTJUhPk","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_238:1","title":"The First Step","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_238:2","title":"Fruits of Labor","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_238:3","title":"Tears of Joy","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_238:4","title":"Shadow Boxing","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_238:5","title":"Three Months to Counter","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_238:6","title":"The Opening Bell of the Rematch","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_238:7","title":"The Destructive Power of one Centimeter","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_238:8","title":"Promise to Meet Again","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_238:9","title":"C Class License","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_238:10","title":"Debut Match!","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_238:11","title":"Obsession for Victory","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_238:12","title":"Becoming a Bully's Buddy","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_238:13","title":"The Eastern Japan Rookie Championship Tournament Begins","released":"2000-10-04T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0481256","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_238:14","title":"Powerful Arms!
