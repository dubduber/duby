At age 23, Yuuri's window for success in skating is closing rapidly, and his love of pork cutlets and aptitude for gaining weight are not helping either.\r\n\r\nHowever, Yuuri finds himself in the spotlight when a video of him performing a routine previously executed by five-time world champion, Victor Nikiforov, suddenly goes viral. In fact, Victor himself abruptly appears at Yuuri's house and offers to be his mentor. As one of his biggest fans, Yuuri eagerly accepts, kicking off his journey to make it back onto the world stage. But the competition is fierce, as the rising star from Russia, Yuri Plisetsky, is relentlessly determined to defeat Yuuri and win back Victor's tutelage.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2016","year":"2016","imdbRating":8.201,"userCount":34285,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"9-xcX0sqkkA","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_11999:1","title":"Easy as Pirozhki!!
