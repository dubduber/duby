They cast a spell used to enslave summoned beasts on him, but that activates his unique ability, Magic Reflect, and the girls end up being the ones put under the spell! And thus begins the otherworldly adventure of a demon lord (pretend) who blazes his own trail through overwhelming power.\r\n\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2018","year":"2018","imdbRating":7.348999999999999,"userCount":17608,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"NlhUse6IMEw","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_41133:1","title":"The Demon Lord Act","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_41133:2","title":"The Strongest Newcomer","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_41133:3","title":"Fallen Assault","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_41133:4","title":"Point-Blank War Dance","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_41133:5","title":"Imperial Knight","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_41133:6","title":"Slave Market","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_41133:7","title":"Change of Heart","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_41133:8","title":"Hero's Charge","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_41133:9","title":"Holy Knight Tale","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_41133:10","title":"Demon Lord's Resurrection","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_41133:11","title":"The Young Girl Awakens","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_41133:12","title":"Battle for Legitimacy","released":"2018-07-05T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt8438524","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt8438524","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt8438524/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
