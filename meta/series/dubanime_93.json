But would your average high school student really enroll himself at the infamous Cromartie High School, known as a breeding ground for the toughest delinquents out there?\r\n\r\nApparently so, as that is exactly what Takashi does, though for reasons he'd rather leave unmentioned. However, one thing is for sure: the \"hard-boiled rabbit in a den full of hungry lions\" is never going to have another dull day. And how could he, now that he's surrounded by mohawked punks, obnoxious robots, and... gorillas? And was that Freddie Mercury riding a horse down the corridor? Follow Takashi as he earnestly dedicates his new high school life to better his school's reputation while his classmates are hellbent on wreaking havoc.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2003-2004","year":"2003-2004","imdbRating":7.81,"userCount":10307,"status":"finished","runtime":"12 min","trailers":"","videos":[{"id":"dubanime_93:1","title":"I Used to be a Bad Boy Bragging Contest","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_93:2","title":"Blade Runners High","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_93:3","title":"Cromartie High (Co-Ed)","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_93:4","title":"Radio Gaga","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_93:5","title":"Sentimental Bus","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_93:6","title":"The Empire of Ambition","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_93:7","title":"Puutan","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_93:8","title":"Electric Warrior","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_93:9","title":"Reboot","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_93:10","title":"Jackson","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_93:11","title":"USA Trip","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_93:12","title":"Road Safety","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_93:13","title":"Joshua Tree","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_93:14","title":"Talking Head","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_93:15","title":"OK Computer","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_93:16","title":"Japan Boss Championships","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_93:17","title":"Let Me Tell You My Name | Get it On","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_93:18","title":"Puutan Gets Fired","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_93:19","title":"Moto-Mechazawa","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_93:20","title":"Lost Relation","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_93:21","title":"A Trip For Heart","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_93:22","title":"You Never Give Me Your Name | Ishii and Goto's Ballad | I Me Mine | Stranger in Strange Land","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_93:23","title":"Stone Cold Crazy | One More Time | With A Shout","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_93:24","title":"Gorilla Sushi","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_93:25","title":"A Hole in Lotta Love | Magic Bath Mat | Stray Cat","released":"2003-10-03T00:00:00.025Z","season":1,"episode":25,"imdb_id":"tt0387775","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":25},{"id":"dubanime_93:26","title":"Suda!!
