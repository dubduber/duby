Takizawa is cheerful, but odd in many waysâ€”he is stark naked and suffers from amnesia, believing himself to be a terrorist. In addition, he possesses a strange cell phone loaded with 8.2 billion yen in digital cash.\r\n\r\nDespite Takizawa's suspicious traits, Saki quickly befriends the enigmatic young man. However, unbeknownst to her, this is the beginning of a thrilling death game involving money, cell phones, and the salvation of the world. Higashi no Eden chronicles Saki's struggle to unravel the mysteries behind her savior, while Takizawa himself battles other individuals armed with similar cell phones and returning memories which reveal his possible connection to the event from months ago.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2009","year":"2009","imdbRating":7.914,"userCount":37023,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"h3dgXYQSeqI","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_4211:1","title":"I Picked Up a Prince","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_4211:2","title":"Melancholic Monday","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_4211:3","title":"On the Night of the Late Show","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_4211:4","title":"True Reality, False Reality","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_4211:5","title":"Now's Not the Time to be Thinking About That","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_4211:6","title":"Eden of the East","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_4211:7","title":"Black Swan Dances","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_4211:8","title":"Search for a Fore-Lost Journey","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_4211:9","title":"The Man Who Lived Too Little","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_4211:10","title":"Who Killed Takizawa Akira?","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_4211:11","title":"The East That Goes On","released":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1415054","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11}],"imdb_id":"tt1415054","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1415054/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
