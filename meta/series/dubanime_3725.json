Besides being 30 years ahead of the world technologically, more than three-fourths of this peculiar city's population consists of students developing their psychic abilities as espers in various institutions. Among these students is Touma Kamijou, a high school boy with the lowest psychic rank of zero, but with a mysterious power no scientist can understand: \"Imagine Breaker,\" which allows him to negate other supernatural abilities.\r\nThis, however, doesn't affect Kamijou's life in the least as he plays his role as a regular teenager; that is, until he meets the strange Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a young girl who has memorized the entire forbidden grimoires, and now a dangerous organization is hunting Index down. With several magicians looking to harm the girl, Kamijou will defend his new companion at all costs as he discovers a strange new realm of the supernatural.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2008-2009","year":"2008-2009","imdbRating":7.502,"userCount":42825,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":"","videos":[{"id":"dubanime_3725:1","title":"Academy City","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_3725:2","title":"Innocentius (The Witch Hunter King)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_3725:3","title":"Necessarius (The Church of Necessary Evil)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_3725:4","title":"Perfect Memory Ability","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_3725:5","title":"Limit (12 o'clock)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_3725:6","title":"Imagine Breaker","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_3725:7","title":"The Science Cult (Misawa Cram School)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_3725:8","title":"Ars Magna (Golden Transmutation)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_3725:9","title":"Deep Blood (Vampire Killer)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_3725:10","title":"Mikoto Misaka (Sissy)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_3725:11","title":"Sisters (Sisters)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_3725:12","title":"Level 6 (Absolute Ability)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_3725:13","title":"Accelerator (One Way)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_3725:14","title":"Weakest vs. Strongest (Strongest vs. Weakest)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_3725:15","title":"Angel Fall (Angel Fall)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_3725:16","title":"Toya Kamijo (Father)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_3725:17","title":"The Power of God (Archangel)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_3725:18","title":"Replica (Impostor)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_3725:19","title":"Last Order (The End)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_3725:20","title":"Virus Code (Final Signal)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_3725:21","title":"Counter Stop (Identity Unknown)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_3725:22","title":"Golem (Stone Figure)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_3725:23","title":"Friends (Hyoka Kazakiri)","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_3725:24","title":"Imaginary Number School District - Five-Element Agency","released":"2008-10-05T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt1308089","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt1308089","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1308089/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
