This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.\r\n\r\nSince he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!\r\n\r\nEnduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in U.A. High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL)","releaseInfo":"2016","year":"2016","imdbRating":8.468,"userCount":224487,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"D5fYOnwYkj4","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_11469:1","title":"Izuku Midoriya: Origin","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_11469:2","title":"What It Takes to Be a Hero","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_11469:3","title":"Roaring Muscles","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_11469:4","title":"Start Line","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_11469:5","title":"What I Can Do For Now","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_11469:6","title":"Rage, You Damn Nerd","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_11469:7","title":"Deku vs. Kacchan","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_11469:8","title":"Bakugo's Start Line","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_11469:9","title":"Yeah, Just Do Your Best, Iida!","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_11469:10","title":"Encounter with the Unknown","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_11469:11","title":"Game Over","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_11469:12","title":"All Might","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_11469:13","title":"In Each of Our Hearts","released":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt5626028","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13}],"imdb_id":"tt5626028","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt5626028/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
