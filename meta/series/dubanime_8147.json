These insatiable beings acquire full control of their host and are able to morph into a variety of forms in order to feed on unsuspecting prey.\r\n\r\nSixteen-year-old high school student Shinichi Izumi falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand instead. Unable to relocate, the parasite, now named Migi, has no choice but to rely on Shinichi in order to stay alive. Thus, the pair is forced into an uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","year":"2014-2015","imdbRating":8.27,"userCount":95057,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"9Oe9umzw1Gc","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_8147:1","title":"Metamorphosis","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_8147:2","title":"Demon in the Flesh","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_8147:3","title":"Feast","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_8147:4","title":"Disheveled Hair","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_8147:5","title":"The Stranger","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_8147:6","title":"The Sun Also Rises","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_8147:7","title":"Dark Night's Passing","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_8147:8","title":"Freezing Point","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_8147:9","title":"Beyond Good and Evil","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_8147:10","title":"What Mad Universe","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_8147:11","title":"The Blue Bird","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_8147:12","title":"Kokoro","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_8147:13","title":"Hello Sadness","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_8147:14","title":"The Selfish Gene","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_8147:15","title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_8147:16","title":"Happy Family","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_8147:17","title":"The Adventure of the Dying Detective","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_8147:18","title":"More than Human","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_8147:19","title":"In Cold Blood","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_8147:20","title":"Crime and Punishment","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_8147:21","title":"Sex and Spirit","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_8147:22","title":"Quiescence and Awakening","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_8147:23","title":"Life and Oath","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_8147:24","title":"Parasyte","released":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt3358020","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt3358020","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt3358020/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
