Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2011","year":"2011","imdbRating":8.272,"userCount":157208,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"27OZc-ku6is","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_5646:1","title":"Turning Point","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_5646:2","title":"Time Travel Paranoia","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_5646:3","title":"Parallel World Paranoia","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_5646:4","title":"Interpreter Rendezvous","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_5646:5","title":"Starmine Rendezvous","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_5646:6","title":"Butterfly Effect's Divergence","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_5646:7","title":"Divergence Singularity","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_5646:8","title":"Chaos Theory Homeostasis I","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_5646:9","title":"Chaos Theory Homeostasis II","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_5646:10","title":"Chaos Theory Homeostasis III","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_5646:11","title":"Dogma in Event Horizon","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_5646:12","title":"Dogma in Ergosphere","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_5646:13","title":"Metaphysics Necrosis","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_5646:14","title":"Physically Necrosis","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_5646:15","title":"Missing Link Necrosis","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_5646:16","title":"Sacrificial Necrosis","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_5646:17","title":"Made in Complex","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_5646:18","title":"Fractal Androgynous","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_5646:19","title":"Endless Apoptosis","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_5646:20","title":"Finalize Apoptosis","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_5646:21","title":"Paradox Meltdown","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_5646:22","title":"Being Meltdown","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_5646:23","title":"Open the Steins Gate","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_5646:24","title":"Achievement Point","released":"2011-04-06T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt1910272","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt1910272","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1910272/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
