Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.\r\nThey don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1986-1989","year":"1986-1989","imdbRating":8.136,"userCount":42188,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"fg_fP7cRJXg","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_199:1","title":"Bulma and Son Goku ","released":"1986-02-26T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_199:2","title":"What the...?!
