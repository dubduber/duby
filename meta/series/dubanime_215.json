With their help, Sasahara slowly adjusts to otaku life in Genshiken.\r\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","releaseInfo":"2004","year":"2004","imdbRating":7.74,"userCount":13234,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"6UvqCC3qQl8","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_215:1","title":"Study of the Modern Visually Oriented Culture","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_215:2","title":"Comparative Classification of the Modern Youth through Consumption and Entertainment","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_215:3","title":"Problems and Merits of Local Culture Promotion","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_215:4","title":"The Sublimating Effects of the Dissimulation Brought on Through Makeup and Costume on Mental Obstacles","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_215:5","title":"Limits of Rejection and Reception as Observed in Autonomous Behaviour","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_215:6","title":"Theory of the Individual Outside the Boundaries of the Subculture","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_215:7","title":"Aspects of Behavioral Selection in Interpersonal Relationships","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_215:8","title":"Comparative Research in Production Models and Processes","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_215:9","title":"Concerning the Existence and Non-Existence of Explanatory Duties Under Specially Confined Circumstances","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_215:10","title":"Leisure Time Expenditures on Fetishism Considered as an Economic Result","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_215:11","title":"The Theory of the Existence of Malice Within Urban Crimes","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_215:12","title":"Countermeasures for Issues that Arise during the Reorganization of a Group","released":"2004-10-10T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0473578","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt0473578","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0473578/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
