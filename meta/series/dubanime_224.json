Instead of hitting the bottom of the well, Kagome ends up 500 years in the past during Japan's violent Sengoku period with the demon's true target, a wish-granting jewel called the Shikon Jewel, reborn inside of her.\r\n\r\nAfter a battle with a revived demon accidentally causes the sacred jewel to shatter, Kagome enlists the help of a young hybrid dog-demon/human named Inuyasha to help her collect the shards and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Joining Kagome and Inuyasha on their quest are the orphan fox-demon Shippo, the intelligent monk Miroku, and the lethal demon slayer Sango. Together, they must set aside their differences and work together to find the power granting shards spread across feudal Japan and deal with the threats that arise.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2000-2004","year":"2000-2004","imdbRating":7.7,"userCount":31627,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"n5f47FVUlrs","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_224:1","title":"The Girl Who Overcame Time... and the Boy Who Was Just Overcome","released":"2000-10-16T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_224:2","title":"Seekers of the Sacred Jewel","released":"2000-10-16T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_224:3","title":"Down the Rabbit Hole and Back Again","released":"2000-10-16T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_224:4","title":"Yura of the Demon-Hair","released":"2000-10-16T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_224:5","title":"Aristocratic Assassin, Sesshomaru","released":"2000-10-16T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_224:6","title":"Tetsusaiga, the Phantom Sword","released":"2000-10-16T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_224:7","title":"Showdown!
