Meanwhile Gareki, a clever thief, is in the midst of robbing her luxurious home. After causing a distraction, Gareki agrees to help Nai escape, but they are discovered upon the woman's return. As she transforms into a ghoulish monster, the boys flee.\r\nOn the run, Nai and Gareki are found by \"Circus,\" a government defense agency that deals with criminal activity too difficult for the police to handle and protects civilians from \"varuga\"â€”terrible monsters that devour humans for sustenance. In the hope that it will lead Nai to his missing friend, he and Gareki decide to join Circus. On their perilous journey, they face dangerous varuga and begin to uncover the secrets behind a shadowy organization known as Kafka.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2013","year":"2013","imdbRating":6.973999999999999,"userCount":12535,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"Ir-O5BpLgm8","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_7364:1","title":"Rainbow Colored Flower Fuse","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1},{"id":"dubanime_7364:2","title":"FORTUNE CAT","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2},{"id":"dubanime_7364:3","title":"ILLUSORY PICNIC","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3},{"id":"dubanime_7364:4","title":"EVENING SWALLOW","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4},{"id":"dubanime_7364:5","title":"CLOWN'S PRESCRIPTION","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5},{"id":"dubanime_7364:6","title":"WING OF SUNRISE","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6},{"id":"dubanime_7364:7","title":"THREE KNIGHTS AND","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7},{"id":"dubanime_7364:8","title":"SILVER BOX","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8},{"id":"dubanime_7364:9","title":"BLUE ROSE","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9},{"id":"dubanime_7364:10","title":"BEASTMASTER'S TEARS","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10},{"id":"dubanime_7364:11","title":"ICE-CREAM PARADE","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11},{"id":"dubanime_7364:12","title":"THE RAINBOW PROMISE","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12},{"id":"dubanime_7364:13","title":"KARNEVAL","released":"2013-04-04T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13}]},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
