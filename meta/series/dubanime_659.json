The story focuses on a small hamlet plagued by monster attacks and living under the shadow of rule by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire lord who has ruled the land for thousands of years. When a young girl is bitten by the Count and chosen as his current plaything, she seeks out help of a quiet wandering stranger, D. It so happens that D is one of the world's best vampire hunters, and he takes it upon himself to cut through Magnus Lee's many minions, and put an end to the Count's rule.\r\n(Source: AniDB)","releaseInfo":"1985","year":"1985","imdbRating":7.034999999999999,"userCount":4795,"status":"finished","runtime":"80 min","trailers":[{"source":"mYWpTOBl3Ic","type":"Trailer"}]},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
