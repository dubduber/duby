Thanks to a premonition from Hitomi, Van successfully kills the dragon, but a pillar of light appears and envelopes them both. As a result, Hitomi finds herself transported to the world of Gaea, a mysterious land where the Earth hangs in the sky.\r\nIn this new land, Hitomi soon discovers that Van is a prince of the Kingdom of Fanelia, which soon falls under attack by the evil empire of Zaibach. In an attempt to fight them off, Van boards his family's ancient guymelef Escaflowne—a mechanized battle suit—but fails to defeat them, and Fanelia ends up destroyed. Now on the run, Hitomi and Van encounter a handsome Asturian knight named Allen Schezar, whom Hitomi is shocked to find looks exactly like her crush from Earth. With some new allies on their side, Van and Hitomi fight back against the forces of Zaibach as the empire strives to revive an ancient power.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1996","year":"1996","imdbRating":7.712000000000001,"userCount":10308,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"8vnP5Sxd49Y","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_159:1","title":"Fateful Confession","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_159:2","title":"The Girl from the Mystic Moon","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_159:3","title":"The Gallant Swordsman","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_159:4","title":"The Diabolical Adonis","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_159:5","title":"The Seal of the Brothers","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_159:6","title":"City of Intrigue","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_159:7","title":"Unexpected Partings","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_159:8","title":"The Day the Angel Flew","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_159:9","title":"Memories of a Feather","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_159:10","title":"The Blue-Eyed Prince","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_159:11","title":"Prophecy of Death","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_159:12","title":"The Secret Door","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_159:13","title":"Red Destiny","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_159:14","title":"Dangerous Wounds","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_159:15","title":"Lost Paradise","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_159:16","title":"The Guided Ones","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_159:17","title":"The Edge of the World","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_159:18","title":"The Gravity of Destiny","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_159:19","title":"Operation Golden Rule of Love","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_159:20","title":"False Vows","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_159:21","title":"Reaction of Fortune","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_159:22","title":"The Black-Winged Angel","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_159:23","title":"Storm Premonition","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_159:24","title":"Fateful Decision","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_159:25","title":"Zone of Absolute Fortune","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.025Z","season":1,"episode":25,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":25},{"id":"dubanime_159:26","title":"Eternal Love","released":"1996-04-02T00:00:00.026Z","season":1,"episode":26,"imdb_id":"tt0138919","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":26}],"imdb_id":"tt0138919","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0138919/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
