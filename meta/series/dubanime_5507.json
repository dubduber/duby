One small caveat: he's now a zombie. Things get even weirder for him when he accidentally steals a magical girl's uniform, and thus her powers! Haruna, the ex-magical girl, orders him to fight evil creatures known as Megalo in her place until they can figure out a way to get her powers back to her.\r\nIt seems that life is just going to get stranger and stranger for poor Ayumu from here on out in Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.","releaseInfo":"2011","year":"2011","imdbRating":7.484999999999999,"userCount":35761,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":"","videos":[{"id":"dubanime_5507:1","title":"Yes, I'm a Magical Garment Girl","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_5507:2","title":"No, It's a Vampire Ninja","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_5507:3","title":"Yes, Hair in Pigtails","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_5507:4","title":"Whoa, Am I Glowing?","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_5507:5","title":"Yeah, That's Kyoto Tofu","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_5507:6","title":"Yes, I Summon Death","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_5507:7","title":"Hey, Which Middle School Are You At?","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_5507:8","title":"Heh, I'm a Schoolyard Wife","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_5507:9","title":"Yes, When I Strip Down, You'll be Amazed","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_5507:10","title":"No, That Will Explode","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_5507:11","title":"Yeah, You Stay With Me!","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_5507:12","title":"Yes, There's Still More","released":"2011-01-11T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt1780262","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt1780262","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt1780262/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
