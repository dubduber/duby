Far from the warmth of family, she has had her share of troubles and pitfalls. Just when all hope seems lost, a fateful encounter awaits her. When a man with the head of a beast, wielding strange powers, obtains her through a slave auction, Chise's life will never be the same again. The man is a \"magus,\"a sorcerer of great power, who decides to free Chise from the bonds of captivity. The magus then makes a bold statement: Chise will become his apprentice--and his bride! \r\n\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","releaseInfo":"2017-2018","year":"2017-2018","imdbRating":8.251999999999999,"userCount":47201,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"Q_2kMsVbqoA","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_13228:1","title":"April showers bring May flowers","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_13228:2","title":"One today is worth two tomorrows","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_13228:3","title":"The balance distinguishes not between gold and lead","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_13228:4","title":"Everything must have a beginning","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_13228:5","title":"Love conquers all","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_13228:6","title":"The Faerie Queene","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_13228:7","title":"Talk of the devil, and he is sure to appear.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_13228:8","title":"Let sleeping dogs lie.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_13228:9","title":"None so deaf as those who will not hear","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_13228:10","title":"We live and learn","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_13228:11","title":"Lovers ever run before the clock","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_13228:12","title":"Better to ask the way than go astray","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_13228:13","title":"East, west, home's best.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_13228:14","title":"Looks breed love.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_13228:15","title":"There is no place like home","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_13228:16","title":"God's mill grinds slow but sure","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_13228:17","title":"Look before you leap","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_13228:18","title":"Forgive and forget","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_13228:19","title":"Any port in a storm.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_13228:20","title":"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_13228:21","title":"Necessity has no law.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_13228:22","title":"As you sow, so shall you reap.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_13228:23","title":"Nothing seek, nothing find.","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_13228:24","title":"Live and let live","released":"2017-10-08T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt7326322","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt7326322","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt7326322/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
