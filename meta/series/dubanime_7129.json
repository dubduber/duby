These mysterious places, known as \"Dungeons,\" are said to be the work of Magi, a class of rare magicians, who also help people build their empires by guiding them to a dungeon. Djinns, supernatural beings that rule over the labyrinths, grant successful conquerors access to their immense power and choose them as potential king candidates to rule the world.\r\nHaving spent life in isolation, Aladdin, a kind and young magician, is eager to explore the world upon finally leaving his home behind. He begins his journey only accompanied by his mentor Ugoâ€”a djinn that Aladdin can summon with his flute. However, Aladdin soon becomes friends with the courageous Alibaba Saluja after causing the destruction of a local merchant's supply cart. In order to pay for the damages, Alibaba suggests that they attempt to conquer the nearest dungeon, taking the first step in an epic adventure that will decide the fate of the world itself.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2012-2013","year":"2012-2013","imdbRating":8.183,"userCount":49728,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"2E7o26G1T0c","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_7129:1","title":"Aladdin and Alibaba","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_7129:2","title":"Dungeon Suite","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_7129:3","title":"The Sorceror of Creation","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_7129:4","title":"People of the Plains","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_7129:5","title":"Dungeon-Capturer","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_7129:6","title":"Fanalis, The Warrior Tribe","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_7129:7","title":"His Name Is Sinbad","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_7129:8","title":"A Promise That Can't Be Kept","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_7129:9","title":"A Prince's Responsibility","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_7129:10","title":"His Name is Judar","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_7129:11","title":"A New Visitor","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_7129:12","title":"Decisions and Farewells","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_7129:13","title":"A Prince in Revolt","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_7129:14","title":"Alibaba's Answer","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_7129:15","title":"Cassim's Answer","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_7129:16","title":"Solomon's Wisdom","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_7129:17","title":"Smile","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_7129:18","title":"Kingdom of Sindria","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_7129:19","title":"The Name of the Culprit is Sinbad","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_7129:20","title":"The Two Princes","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_7129:21","title":"The Dungeon Zagan","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_7129:22","title":"Household of Flames","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_7129:23","title":"Battle Cry","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_7129:24","title":"The Fall","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_7129:25","title":"Alibaba and Aladdin","released":"2012-10-07T00:00:00.025Z","season":1,"episode":25,"imdb_id":"tt2425098","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":25}],"imdb_id":"tt2425098","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt2425098/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
