But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.\r\nTwo years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari. However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.\r\nBased on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story of Kousei's recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","year":"2014-2015","imdbRating":8.273,"userCount":128869,"status":"finished","runtime":"22 min","trailers":[{"source":"AbTfMbmucpI","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_8403:1","title":"Monotone/Colorful","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_8403:2","title":"Friend A","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_8403:3","title":"Inside Spring","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_8403:4","title":"The Journey","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_8403:5","title":"Gray Skies","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_8403:6","title":"On the Way Home","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_8403:7","title":"The Shadows Whisper","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_8403:8","title":"Let It Ring","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_8403:9","title":"Resonance","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_8403:10","title":"The Scenery I Shared with You","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_8403:11","title":"Light of Life","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_8403:12","title":"Twinkle Little Star","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_8403:13","title":"Love's Sorrow","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_8403:14","title":"Footprints","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_8403:15","title":"Liar","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_8403:16","title":"Two of a Kind","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_8403:17","title":"Twilight","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_8403:18","title":"Hearts Come Together","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_8403:19","title":"Goodbye, Hero","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_8403:20","title":"Hand in Hand","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_8403:21","title":"Snow","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_8403:22","title":"Spring Wind","released":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt3895150","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22}],"imdb_id":"tt3895150","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt3895150/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
