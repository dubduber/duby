This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.\r\nWith his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earth—one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1989-1996","year":"1989-1996","imdbRating":8.209999999999999,"userCount":49377,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"Mgowy7ybsQ8","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_720:1","title":"Mini-Goku is an Overprotected Boy!
