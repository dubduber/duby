However, a small subset of the Knights supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of Liones. They were defeated by the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the \"Seven Deadly Sins,\" were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\r\n\r\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"2014-2015","year":"2014-2015","imdbRating":8.373000000000001,"userCount":173118,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"wxcvbL6o55M","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_8699:1","title":"The Seven Deadly Sins","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_8699:2","title":"Sword of The Holy Knight","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_8699:3","title":"The Sin of the Sleeping Forest","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_8699:4","title":"A Young Girl's Dream","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_8699:5","title":"Even If You Were To Die","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_8699:6","title":"Ballad of the Beginning","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_8699:7","title":"Touching Reunion","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_8699:8","title":"Dreadful Pursuer","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_8699:9","title":"Dark Pulse","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_8699:10","title":"Byzel Fight Festival","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_8699:11","title":"Sentiment of Many Years","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_8699:12","title":"Terrifying Cannon","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_8699:13","title":"Disciple of Destruction","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_8699:14","title":"A Person Who Reads","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_8699:15","title":"Unholy Knight","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_8699:16","title":"Incited Legends","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_8699:17","title":"First Casualty","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_8699:18","title":"Even If I Have To Give Up My Life For It","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_8699:19","title":"The Fairy King Who Waited In Vain","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_8699:20","title":"Courage Charm","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_8699:21","title":"Imminent Threat","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_8699:22","title":"What I Can Do For You","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_8699:23","title":"Descent Into Despair","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_8699:24","title":"Heroes","released":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt3909224","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt3909224","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt3909224/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
