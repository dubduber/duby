One such case is the police's constant pursuit of Celty Sturluson, the Headless Rider. Moreover, someone has placed a large bounty on her, igniting the motivation of gang members all over to begin searching for the supernatural creature as well. Meanwhile, Mikado Ryuugamine is approached by Aoba Kuronuma, a mysterious underclassman with unknown intentions, who reveals that he knows Mikado's true identity.\r\nBut Ikebukuro's state of tranquility is short-lived, as a new threat appears in the form of a murderer who goes by the pseudonym \"Hollywood,\" known for wearing a different mask each time they commit a crime. As the various events taking place prove to be connected yet again, Ikebukuro is thrown into another conflict that threatens to engulf the entire city in chaos.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"2015","year":"2015","imdbRating":8.079,"userCount":29705,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":[{"source":"f5yXNsIPw5U","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_8314:1","title":"A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_8314:2","title":"Harmony Is the Greatest of Virtues","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_8314:3","title":"Adding Insult to Injury","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_8314:4","title":"When in Rome, Do as the Romans Do","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_8314:5","title":"No One Knows what the Future Holds","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_8314:6","title":"A Crow in the Dark Night","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_8314:7","title":"Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_8314:8","title":"The Ladies' Man Has Neither Money Nor Power","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_8314:9","title":"The Night is Falling, and the Way is Long","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_8314:10","title":"Like Father, Like Son","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_8314:11","title":"No Use Crying Over Spilt Milk","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_8314:12","title":"Adversity Makes a Man Strong","released":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt4755410","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12}],"imdb_id":"tt4755410"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
