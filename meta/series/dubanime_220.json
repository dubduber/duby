Okay, so he's mostly reformed.\r\nHowever, strict administrators and a class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl.\r\nSo get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka.\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","releaseInfo":"1999-2000","year":"1999-2000","imdbRating":8.251999999999999,"userCount":39428,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","videos":[{"id":"dubanime_220:1","title":"GTO-The Legend Begins","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_220:2","title":"Enter Uchiyamada!","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_220:3","title":"Late Night Roof Diving","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_220:4","title":"The Secret Life of Onizuka","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_220:5","title":"An Eye for an Eye, a Butt for a Butt","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_220:6","title":"Conspiracies All Around","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_220:7","title":"The Mother of all Crushes","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_220:8","title":"Bungee Jumping Made Easy","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_220:9","title":"Onizuka and the Art of War","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_220:10","title":"Outside Looking In","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_220:11","title":"To Be Idolized by a Nation","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_220:12","title":"The Formula for Treachery","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_220:13","title":"Only the Best Will Do","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_220:14","title":"Between a Rock and a Hard Place","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_220:15","title":"The Great Sacrifice","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_220:16","title":"Beauty + Brains = A Dangerous Mix","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_220:17","title":"Falling for The Great Onizuka","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_220:18","title":"How to Dine and Dash","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_220:19","title":"Private Investigations","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_220:20","title":"Love Letters","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_220:21","title":"Revolution Everywhere","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_220:22","title":"The Art of Demolition","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_220:23","title":"Superstition","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_220:24","title":"Compromising Positions","released":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt0315008","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_220:25","title":"Playing Doctor -
