Deeply meditative and cooler than zero, the series follows the existential adventures of the apt marksman Kino along with talking motorcycle Hermes as they travel the world and learn much about themselves in the process. Imaginative, thought-provoking, and sometimes disturbing, Kino's journey is documented in an episodic style with an emphasis on atmosphere rather than action or plot, though still prevalent.","releaseInfo":"2003","year":"2003","imdbRating":8.184999999999999,"userCount":21847,"status":"finished","runtime":"24 min","trailers":"","videos":[{"id":"dubanime_447:1","title":"Land of Visible Pain","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_447:2","title":"A Tale of Feeding Off Others","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_447:3","title":"Land of Prophecies","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_447:4","title":"Land of Adults","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_447:5","title":"Three Men Along the Rails","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_447:6","title":"Coliseum (Part 1)","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_447:7","title":"Coliseum (Part 2)","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_447:8","title":"Land of Wizards","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_447:9","title":"Land of Books","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_447:10","title":"A Tale of Mechanical Dolls","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_447:11","title":"Her Journey","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_447:12","title":"A Peaceful Land","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_447:13","title":"A Kind Land","released":"2003-04-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0433498","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13}],"imdb_id":"tt0433498","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0433498/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
