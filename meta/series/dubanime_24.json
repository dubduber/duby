Day in and day out, putting his life on the line just to make enough to get by, he moves from one bloodshed to the next.\r\n\r\nAfter a run-in with the Band of the Hawk, a formidable troop of mercenaries, Guts is recruited by their charismatic leader Griffith, nicknamed the \"White Hawk.\" As he quickly climbed the ranks in order to become the head of the offensive faction, Guts proves to be a mighty addition to Griffith's force, taking Midland by storm. However, while the band's quest for recognition continues, Guts slowly realizes that the world is not as black-and-white as he once assumed.\r\n\r\nSet in the medieval era, Berserk is a dark, gritty tale that follows one man's struggle to find his own path, while supporting another's lust for power, and the unimaginable tragedy that begins to turn the wheels of fate.\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","releaseInfo":"1997-1998","year":"1997-1998","imdbRating":8.241,"userCount":34057,"status":"finished","runtime":"25 min","trailers":[{"source":"XUsev2OJlz8","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_24:1","title":"The Black Swordsman","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_24:2","title":"Band of the Hawk","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_24:3","title":"First Battle","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_24:4","title":"The Hand of God","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_24:5","title":"Sword and the Wind","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_24:6","title":"Zodd the Immortal","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_24:7","title":"The Sword's Owner","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_24:8","title":"Conspiracy","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_24:9","title":"Assassination","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_24:10","title":"Nobleman","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_24:11","title":"The Battle","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_24:12","title":"Together","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_24:13","title":"Prepared For Death","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_24:14","title":"Bonfire of Dreams","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_24:15","title":"The Decisive Battle","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_24:16","title":"The Conqueror","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_24:17","title":"Moment of Glory","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_24:18","title":"Tombstone of Flames","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_24:19","title":"Separation","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_24:20","title":"Spark","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_24:21","title":"Confession","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_24:22","title":"Infiltration","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_24:23","title":"Eve of the Feast","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_24:24","title":"The Great Eclipse","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24},{"id":"dubanime_24:25","title":"Time of Eternity","released":"1997-10-08T00:00:00.025Z","season":1,"episode":25,"imdb_id":"tt0318871","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":25}],"imdb_id":"tt0318871","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0318871/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
