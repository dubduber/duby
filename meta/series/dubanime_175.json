The rich seek to satisfy their desires and derive pleasure for themselves, and Tokyo has materialized into such a city as a result. Saiga, once a war photographer, works for Hibara Ginza in the capitalist state of Tokyo. He infiltrates the Roppongi Club, a secretive base located in the red light district of the city, to collect information about them. However, he was caught in the process and brought forward to a girl called Kagura who was in the midst of a ritual. His contact with Kagura awakens his special ability: the power to make things explode when photographed. In order to unravel the mystery behind the Roppongi Club and Kagura, Saiga begins his solitary battle.","releaseInfo":"2005","year":"2005","imdbRating":7.261,"userCount":7667,"status":"finished","runtime":"23 min","trailers":[{"source":"VZcketoapI8","type":"Trailer"}],"videos":[{"id":"dubanime_175:1","title":"Depravity City","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.001Z","season":1,"episode":1,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":1},{"id":"dubanime_175:2","title":"Goddess of Greed","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.002Z","season":1,"episode":2,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":2},{"id":"dubanime_175:3","title":"Film Like a Bullet","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.003Z","season":1,"episode":3,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":3},{"id":"dubanime_175:4","title":"Lethal Headshot","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.004Z","season":1,"episode":4,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":4},{"id":"dubanime_175:5","title":"Best friend of Diamonds","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.005Z","season":1,"episode":5,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":5},{"id":"dubanime_175:6","title":"Out of Focus","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.006Z","season":1,"episode":6,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":6},{"id":"dubanime_175:7","title":"The Big Picture","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.007Z","season":1,"episode":7,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":7},{"id":"dubanime_175:8","title":"Dentophobia","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.008Z","season":1,"episode":8,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":8},{"id":"dubanime_175:9","title":"Into the Bath","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.009Z","season":1,"episode":9,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":9},{"id":"dubanime_175:10","title":"Suitengu Cometh","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.010Z","season":1,"episode":10,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":10},{"id":"dubanime_175:11","title":"Mother Critical","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.011Z","season":1,"episode":11,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":11},{"id":"dubanime_175:12","title":"Left Hand Lullaby","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.012Z","season":1,"episode":12,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":12},{"id":"dubanime_175:13","title":"Ginza the Lawless","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.013Z","season":1,"episode":13,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":13},{"id":"dubanime_175:14","title":"The Wedding Photographer","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.014Z","season":1,"episode":14,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":14},{"id":"dubanime_175:15","title":"Hell is a Wet Woman","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.015Z","season":1,"episode":15,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":15},{"id":"dubanime_175:16","title":"Audit the Wicked","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.016Z","season":1,"episode":16,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":16},{"id":"dubanime_175:17","title":"The Reaper and the Nouveau Riche","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.017Z","season":1,"episode":17,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":17},{"id":"dubanime_175:18","title":"Fates and Fists","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.018Z","season":1,"episode":18,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":18},{"id":"dubanime_175:19","title":"Lips and Lies","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.019Z","season":1,"episode":19,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":19},{"id":"dubanime_175:20","title":"Good Vibrations","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.020Z","season":1,"episode":20,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":20},{"id":"dubanime_175:21","title":"All Hail the Glutton","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.021Z","season":1,"episode":21,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":21},{"id":"dubanime_175:22","title":"Money, Money, Money","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.022Z","season":1,"episode":22,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":22},{"id":"dubanime_175:23","title":"Tender Grave","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.023Z","season":1,"episode":23,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":23},{"id":"dubanime_175:24","title":"The Roppongi Crises","released":"2005-04-08T00:00:00.024Z","season":1,"episode":24,"imdb_id":"tt0805960","imdbSeason":1,"imdbEpisode":24}],"imdb_id":"tt0805960","logo":"https://images.metahub.space/logo/medium/tt0805960/img"},"cacheMaxAge":4320}
